Description: lightweight OCI runtime for running containers
 crun is a command line program for running Linux containers that follow the
 Open Container Initiative (OCI) format. It is alternative to runc, but fully
 written in C, and focused on being fast and low-memory.
 .
 As an OCI runtime, crun is low-level and primarily intended to be used through
 a container engine, such as podman, docker, and containerd.
